# Multiverse Evolution

In the galapagotchi universe there are bodies without brains. The bodies have limbs covered in muscular faces which can twitch, but there is no nervous system.

The gotchis discover how to crawl by **natural selection**, building their own genes by trial and error.

When a gotchi enters evolution mode, it creates a population of imperfect clones of itself which compete at the same time in the same place, which suggests a kind of "multiverse".

The ghostly gotchi clones are superimposed over each other so that the subtle differences between their movement is evident.

Watching the evolution take place can help build an **intuition** about the natural selection that gave us life.

## The Language of Dice ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅

The genetic language is made of six different possible "words". Each word corresponds with the outcome of throwing a die.

A newborn gotchi has empty genes. When it needs muscle instructions, the dice are thrown and outcomes are recorded, because they will later be passed on to "children".

When a gotchi clones itself, the sequence of dice (genes) are copied verbatim, but occasionally a die is "dropped on the floor", but inserted anyway, regardless of the outcome.

## Choice, Timing, and Twitch Speed

The interpretation of dice genes is perfectly deterministic. An instruction sequence chooses which triangle, and then when and how to twitch it.

The first four dice between **( ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ )** and **( ⚅ ⚅ ⚅ ⚅ )**, generate a number which is used to decide which muscle face to twitch (using modulo).

The twitch timing is based on a cycle divided in six parts, so the next die **( ⚀ to ⚅ )** determines which part of the cycle the twitch begins.

Twitches can be quick or slow, so one more die **( ⚀ to ⚅ )** gives the twitch speed.

## Direction Genes

Going forward is the first skill to develop, but the gene sequence that evolves for going forward will not make the body turn left or right. There are therefore separate genes for the different directions.

A gotchi always has a goal, which is the next place it wants to go. When that goal is ahead, the forward gene is activated. When it is to the left or right, the turning genes are activated instead.

It is important to train your gotchi so that it is able to move in all these directions efficiently.
