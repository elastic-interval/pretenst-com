# Multiverse Evolution

In the galapagotchi universe there are bodies without brains. The bodies have limbs covered in muscular faces which can twitch, but there is no nervous system.

The gotchis discover how to crawl by **natural selection**, building their own genes by trial and error.

When a gotchi enters evolution mode, it creates a population of imperfect clones of itself which compete at the same time in the same place, which suggests a kind of "multiverse".

The ghostly gotchi clones are superimposed over each other so that the subtle differences between their movement is evident.

Watching the evolution take place can help build an **intuition** about the natural selection that gave us life.

## The Language of Dice ( ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅ )

The genetic language is made of six different possible "words". Each word corresponds with the outcome of throwing a die.

A newborn gotchi has empty genes. When it needs muscle instructions, the dice are thrown and outcomes are recorded, because they will later be passed on to "children".

When a gotchi clones itself, the sequence of dice (genes) are copied verbatim, but occasionally a die is "dropped on the floor", but inserted anyway, regardless of the outcome.

## Muscle choice, timing, and speed

The interpretation of dice genes is perfectly deterministic. An instruction sequence chooses which triangle, and then when and how to twitch it.

### Which muscle face: **( ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ ) ⮕ ( ⚅ ⚅ ⚅ ⚅ )**

The first four dice are used to decide which muscle face to twitch (1296 choices modulo the number of muscle faces).

### When: **( ⚀ ⚀ ) ⮕ ( ⚅ ⚅ )**

The twitch timing is based on a cycle divided in 36 parts, so the next two dice  determines which part of the cycle the twitch begins.

### How fast: **( ⚀ ⚀ ) ⮕ ( ⚅ ⚅ )**

Twitches can be quick or slow, so the next two dice determine the attack and decay of the twitch. So for example **( ⚀ ⚅ )** would pull slowly and then let go quickly.

## Grasping Gene

The surface acts soft and rough in that there is friction, and a limb can penetrate but not very deeply. When the limb is submerged, it can grasp to its current location for a time.

### Which limb: **( ⚀ ) ⮕ ( ⚃ ), ( ⚄ ) ( ⚅ )**

There are four limbs which can grasp, so one die determines either which limb, or in the case of **( ⚄ )** and **( ⚅ )** 

### When: **( ⚀ ⚀ ) ⮕ ( ⚅ ⚅ )**

Just as with twich times, the grasp time is a choice of one of the 36 parts of the cycle.

### How long: **( ⚀ ) ⮕ ( ⚅ )**

All grasp actions are for a limited time, and one die is used to determine whether it will hold for a short or a long time.

## Direction Genes ( ⬅ ⬆ ➡ )

Going forward is the first skill to develop, but the gene sequence that evolves for going forward will not make the body turn left or right. There are therefore separate genes for the different directions.

A gotchi always has a goal, which is the next place it wants to go. As it moves, its point of view of its goal changes.

When that goal is ahead, the forward gene is activated. When it is to the left or right, the turning genes are activated instead.

## Evolution strategy

In some ways you cannot control the evolution that takes place, because that's the nature of it. You do have some control over what your gotchi evolves towards.

For example, if you first carefully evolve a gene to crawl forward very efficiently, and then later evolve the genes for turning left and right, you may notice that the most successful competitors are the ones that evolve to turn quickly so that the already-advanced forward gene can take over again.

In other words, the left and right genes would not so much tend to crawl in the appropriate direction, but instead they would tend to rather quickly turn the body and be done with it.
