# Dynamic Shape

Every structure is to some degree dynamic, since they all exist in time and can be deformed, however slightly. We can imagine this if we zoom in. Tapping on one side of a piece of diamond causes a shockwave of atomic scale forces which make their way across the crystal lattice of the diamond over to the other side where the tap can be felt, but the effect inevitably takes time to get from one side to the other. When we don't see this, we are simply not looking closely enough.

The pretenst structures that we explore here expose the dynamic nature of structure by making it explicit. A disturbance in one part of a pretenst structure shakes the next element, which shakes the next, until the entire shape is chaotically jittering. The wave of disturbance are there for us to observe, and it should trigger our imagination to picture how this is actually happening always and everywhere.
