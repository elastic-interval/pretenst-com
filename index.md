# Open Source Tensegrity

If you saw this structure at [Wildeburg](https://wildeburg.nl/) festival, then give me a shout at **pretenst@gmail.com** and let me know what you think! To tag along for more, follow [De Twips](https://www.instagram.com/detwips?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) on Instagram.

If you're standing beside it now, send me a selfie!

If you found yourself staring at it and seeing that there were some things that looked **not quite right**, then I have but one thing to say to you:

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<I>"I seek the finest and the bravest Knights in the 
land to join me in my court at Camelot. You have 
proved yourself worthy. Will you join me?"</I>
<br>
- Arthur, King of the Britons (coincidentally also pretenst@gmail.com)
<br>
</div>

In other words, this is **Open Source**, meaning that you get to see how it is made. So if you are interested, or even maybe want to get involved in the future projects like this, let me know.

## A Little about Art

This all began as a software project, and I am at heart a software developer (sorry, so this is going to get weird). When I think of art, I think of what [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) describes.

<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
In machine learning, a loss function measures how  
far off a model's predictions are from the desired 
outcomes - it quantifies error or deviation. The 
system learns by minimizing this loss function, 
essentially being guided by its mistakes.
<br><br>
Rather than seeing these limitations as obstacles to 
overcome, the artist develops an aesthetic 
appreciation for the very thing that creates tension 
between intention and outcome. The "loss function" 
becomes not just a tool for improvement, but a 
source of creative discovery and emotional resonance.

# Background: Only Push and Pull

In the 1960s [Ken Snelson](http://kennethsnelson.net/) first explored what could be done (artistically) with structures that were *based on using only continuous tension and floating compression*, and [Bucky Fuller](https://www.bfi.org/) elaborated the philosophical implications and called it **tensegrity**. [Tom Flemons](http://intensiondesigns.ca/archive/) showed us what it could mean in terms of biology. 

The **Pretenst** project starts *in the abstract* with a [home grown software model](https://github.com/elastic-interval/pretenst) (minimal physics engine) called **elastic interval geometry**, and extends the exploration into what can be [designed](https://pretenst.com/app/) and ultimately built in physical form when you work in terms of only push and pull forces.
