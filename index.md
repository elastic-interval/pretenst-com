# Pretenst Design

If you imagine for a second you can picture something that **pulls** two other things together, then soon after you should also be able to picture the opposite, something that **pushes** two things apart.

What is much harder to imagine is what you can do with these two simple ideas when you put them together.

    What could possibly be built from pushes and pulls alone?

That question prompted me to build "Elastic Interval Geometry" as a computer model of a universe of *push and pull*, implemented as simply as possible.

After many years of testing the limits of what the model could do (an out-of-control hobby), and building quite elaborate algorithms around it for automated construction, I reached a local maximum of how fun it was to do things virtually.

I even went so far as to build "muscle" systems and let the push-pull structures compete in a [darwinian competition for survival](https://pretenst.com/app/#evolution), judged on their ability to coordinate twitches to crawl, walk or run to their target.

I found myself drawn back to physical space, wondering what could actually be built in the **real world**. 

Many people learn with their hands.

# Tensegrity

**Tensegrity**, is a [real world art form](http://kennethsnelson.net/), as well as a [collection of ideas](https://books.google.nl/books/about/A_Fuller_Explanation.html?id=G8zttcNdKBAC), and it was above all the ideas which had fascinated me for decades.

The defining feature of tensegrity is that the **floating struts** don't touch each other and only held in place by a **network of cables**. The shape maintains its integrity because of the tension, with or without gravity.

When I began to build the structures in the real world, I was confronted with entirely new challenges. The biggest hurdle was always at the place where *push* and *pull* met each other, the connection **joints**.

# Mission

Before a tensegrity takes its shape, it must be must be **pre-tensioned**.

Tensegrity structures are really hard to build, but the results are very satisfying, so the mission became to

    make it easier so that more people could do it

**Pretenst** tensegrity structures are built by hand, but the tension is connected up while the cords are [**slack**](https://subgenius.fandom.com/wiki/Slack) so it's never about pulling a cord tight.

This is a much easier way, and only later on does the structure as a whole get tensioned, and then by *lengthening the struts*.

Building these structures became easier after a year or more of [experimentation](construction/2020/06/15/prefab-tension-1) to find the right materials and techniques, but now I can finally offer an [inexpensive kit](https://getpretenst.com/) to people all over the world.

You can [get one for yourself or someone who should have it](https://getpretenst.com/), and spread the fun of learning with your hands!
