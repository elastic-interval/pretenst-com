# What is this?

"Pretenst" structure, otherwise known as [**tensegrity**](http://kennethsnelson.net/), is distilled down to the basics of **push** and **pull**, making all of the forces visible. It is minimal, and as a result these structures appear to defy gravity, and that gives them their elegant beauty.

The defining feature of tensegrity is that the pushing elements or bars are **floating**, separated from each other and only held together by a **network of tension**. The shape maintains its integrity because of the tension, with or without gravity, since the compression pushing outwards is only localized.

This project has two parts. It is both about a piece of open source software, and about projects to build real world tensegrity structures.

## Design Software

Pretenst software is an open source [online tool](/app) for designing four-dimensional physical structures made from elements of pure compression (struts) and tension (cables) and exploring how they behave over time and under stress.

The app generates tensegrities based on a minimal language called "[tenscript](tenscript.md)". For example, the structure called "Halo by Crane" was generated with this short script: 

**L(5,S92,b(12,S92,MA1),d(11,S92,MA1))**

With all the numbers from the generated virtual model, it became possible to [build](/construction/2020/10/26/halo-1) the real physical object!

Scripts have also been written for importing structures into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for generating [high resolution renderings](gallery.md).

## Physical Models

The articles below record the progression of projects and technique refinements which seem to be a necessary part of the journey to really understand this structural principle. 

Anything is possible in the virtual world, and although the behavior is convincing and accurate to seven digits, it completely sidesteps the details of the connection mechanism, and the imperfections of real world materials. Building physical pretenst objects exposes us to the realities of tension and compression.

One fairly unique feature of our approach here is that the **tension** network is almost always assembled in a **slack** state and only tightened later. High tension is achieved purely by effectively **lengthening** the compression elements instead.

It is this approach which enabled the building of complex tensegrity structures, and primarily because it becomes possible to return the structure to a slack state temporarily for repairs or adjustments.
