# Only Push and Pull

In the 1960s [Ken Snelson](http://kennethsnelson.net/) first explored what could be done (artistically) with structures that were *based on using only continuous tension and floating compression*, and [Bucky Fuller](https://www.bfi.org/) elaborated the philosophical implications and called it **tensegrity**. [Tom Flemons](http://intensiondesigns.ca/archive/) showed us what it could mean in terms of biology. 

The **Pretenst** project starts *in the abstract* with a [home grown software model](https://github.com/elastic-interval/pretenst) (minimal physics engine) called **elastic interval geometry**, and extends the exploration into what can be [designed](https://pretenst.com/app/) and ultimately built in physical form when you work in terms of only push and pull forces.

# Your Hands

Unfortunately, pictures and movies and even live virtual models fail to really communicate what tensegrity is. The only way to really internalize this idea is to give it to your hands.

If you're going to be using these structures to communicate ideas with others, you need structures which are durable and robust so they last for years.

Beyond that, there is a whole new dimension of understanding available if you can change the tensegrity from loose to tight and back. Few get this.

Give your hands a treat by ordering your own **adjustable** tensegrity kit at [getpretenst.com](https://getpretenst.com/).
