# Design Play

The only way to effectively explore something that you don't already know really well is to play, so the pretenst app gives us a very flexible world where we can  quickly learn by trial and error. The idea is to start with all the options open and gradually refine towards and end result.

The pretenst design software starts playfully but it isn't just for play, it goes further than that. Ultimately we intend this end result to be a beautiful physical tensegrity structure that you can display in the living room, or maybe a larger one that can be mounted as a sculpture in the lobby, or even a huge one in a city park or mounted on a building.

Beyond a decorative function, we intend to explore more practical applications of tensegrity in any domain where we can show it to be useful.

Whether the scale is large or small, this project is about developing and spreading the understanding and technology that will be needed to make **real physical structures**.

## Generate, Shape, Zen Freeze, Realize

After generating the pretenst structure, the app gives you ways of turning it into the shape that you want. Everything starts under heavy pretension with very elastic elements, so you can bend and squeeze as much as you like.

## Playing with Physics

The pretenst model lets us "play god" and toy with physics, since we're able to change all the physics features freely on the fly while modeling. The real world is far too restricted when you want to really explore this design space. In the real world we experience constant gravity, and our building materials have unchanging features like their elasticity and density. While designing, we need to be free!

Ultimately, of course, when we get to the stage of building the actual physical structures, we must dial back the reckless carefree physics and bring it back to the actual challenges that face us here on Earth (or on the Moon, or in outer space, depending on the goals). The pretenst software is built to take us gradually from the unreal into the real, the objective being always to find ways to build **physical things**.

## Visualizing the Pretension

Pushing elements (bars) are being compressed to be slightly shorter than they would be without the tension, and pulling elements (cables) are being stretched slightly longer than they would be without the bars. In a pretenst tensegrity, everything is strained a bit, because otherwise the structure wouldn't be stiff. This is the heart of the matter!

In the real world such strains are certainly measurable, sometimes visible, but builders need to understand them intimately so that they can do the numbers and make sure things are built to last and carry loads without collapsing.

The pretenst software is all about fostering a deeper understanding of this very thing, so the visualization is set up to allow users to greatly exaggerate the effects of strain. This is very useful in exposing to the designer where the strain is intense and where it is weak or absent altogether.

What the visualization does, almost paradoxically, is that it shows the pushing and pulling elements at the length that they would be if each of them indidually were not strained at all! Compressed bars appear a little bit longer, and stretched cables appear a little bit shorter, so in this visualizztion the two actually do not touch each other (unless the strain happens to be zero).

Depending on the physics parameters, the effect may be so small that you cannot even see it, so pretenst has a feature which multiplies the effect to bring it unambiguously into view.
