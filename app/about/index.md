# The Galapagotchi project

Welcome to the "Universe" of the *Galapagotchi* ... enough like our world, but it's fictional, and cartoon-simple. It shows how evolution works, and we invite developers to [tinker](https://github.com/elastic-interval/galapagotchi).

 We aim to build an online resource which is specially tuned to be an illustration of Evolution by Natural Selection which [**Charles Darwin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) observed in nature. The minimalist triangle and hexagon based aesthetic is inspired by the futurist work of [**Buckminster Fuller**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller), and the simplicity it brings makes the evolution more transparent. 

Everything here is made of math and it's all in this project, from the simulation of *time* in the *physics* to the *evolution* algorithm. The whole process, up to the [blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker) mutating of genes, is transparent and ready to be explored.

The best way to understand it is to start with first principles, so the starting place which leads to everything else is the [interval](interval.md). This will lead to how [time](time.md) is treated, and eventually to how the [evolution](evolution.md) works, with some interesting stops in between.
