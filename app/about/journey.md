# Journey

A **journey** starts at the center spot of a *gotchi*'s home [hexalot](hexalot.md) and proceeds from neighbor to neighbor following a path that the user sets up. To be successful, a *gotchi* will have to run from one neighbor to the other, turning where necessary.

The red arrows show the legs of the *journey* so here, for example, after the first leg of the *journey* the gotchi will have to take a hard right turn.

The *gotchi*'s user can visit the *Galapagotchi* world and change its journey plans anytime. Whenever the *gotchi* is woken up, it has just one singular goal, and that is to go on its journey.

> Note that this isn't really a "game" quite yet. Ideas welcome, let's talk.
