# Muscle

Muscle behavior is accomplished by adjusting the **preferred length** of an [interval](interval.md) over time. Without muscle behavior, an *interval* behaves like a spring and not much happens beyond wobbling.

Keep in mind that in the peculiar universe of *Galapagotchi* the muscle is not *aware* of other muscles. The way that muscles coordinate so that the body successfully runs is Darwin's [evolution](evolution.md) by natural selection, where the least fit members of a population are sometimes forgotten.

The reality is that the *muscles* do not coordinate at all, they are just **lucky**! They simply happen to belong to a body that has survived in running competition with others. They have no idea why they are in a winning body.

### Body clock

The *gotchi* body is a surviving collection of *muscle intervals* connected at their ends. According to the [genes](gene.md), each muscle knows how to behave, and its behavior is to lengthen and shorten over time.

We could say that a *muscle* has a clock face inside for each of the four [directions](sense.md), but they start with no hands and no markings except ticks. When a *gotchi* is born, the [gene](gene.md) for each *direction behavior* is read in order to mark the clock facees of each muscle with **(long)** and **(short)**.

The only source of information that a *muscle* has is **body clock** which puts a **hand** on the muscle's clock face. Every 50 or so cycles of [time](time.md), the muscles wake up and each one checks the clock and adjusts the preferred length of its [interval](interval.md).

### Bilateral symmetry
