# Six Twist Essential

Congratulations! You finally have this amazing tensegrity structure in your hands!

You get the *6TE* in **collapsed form**, so the first thing you will have to do is assemble it.

## Assembly

It's easy if you go slowly and **one by one**. There are six bars to insert, and each one of them replaces a connector nut which is currently holding the end bolts together.

1. choose one of the connector nuts
1. turn until it comes apart
1. turn the other way until it comes off
1. insert the aluminum bar
1. repeat

## Tightening

By turning by hand the **adjustment nut** that touches the end of the aluminum bar, you can effectively lengthen each bar.

We recommend turning each and every adjustment nut in the entire structure an equal amount, so keep lengthening the shortest bar that you can find.

It is easier to turn the screws if you pretend that your hands are pulling back a bow-and-arrow each time, so the nut is free to turn.

At some point you will realize that it is no longer really possible to turn the nuts tighter by hand, and then you should switch to turning each nut with the wrench.

## Experimentation

You might want to try:

* loosening and making an arch
* adding elastic connections in special places
* advanced: change the chirality so it has all left-handed or all right-handed twists
* add balloons!
