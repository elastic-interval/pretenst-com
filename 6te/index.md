Congratulations! You finally have this amazing tensegrity structure in your hands!

## Assembly

You get the *6TE* in **collapsed form**, so the first thing you will have to do is assemble it.

All you have to do is insert six bars, one by one, like this:

### The Steps

1. choose one of the connector nuts
1. turn until it comes apart
1. turn the other way until it comes off
1. insert the aluminum bar
1. repeat

## Tightening

By turning by hand the **adjustment nut** that touches the end of each aluminum bar, you can effectively lengthen each bar.

We recommend turning each and every adjustment nut in the entire structure an equal amount, so keep lengthening the shortest bar that you can find.

It is easier to turn the screws if you pretend that your hands are pulling back a bow-and-arrow each time, so the nut is free to turn.

At some point you will realize that it is no longer really possible to turn the nuts tighter by hand, and then you should switch to turning each nut with the wrench.

## Loosening

You may like to have the structure standing tall like a tower, but you can also choose to loosen the adjustment nuts everywhere by the same amount, and then bend your *Six Twist Essential* into a beautiful **arch**.

The structure *automatically re-tightens* as you bring its ends together.

## Augmenting

You might want to try getting your *6TE* in a particular chosen shape, and then adding extra connections with thread or elastic between the joints so that it *keeps that shape*. 

You will have to decide which extra connections to make for your purpose.

## Chirality Switch

The tension network of the *6TE* is not built to have a fixed direction of twist for its segments. 

The directions when you get it alternates *(Left-Right-Left-Right-Left-Right)*, but if you are ambitious and daring, you might want to remove and re-insert bars to make it *(Left-Left-Left-Left-Left-Left)* or *(Right-Right-Right-Right-Right-Right)*. 

The twists of the *6TE* will then form a **spiral**.

## Imagination

The rest is up to your imagination.
