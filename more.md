# Pretenst

## Dynamic Shape

Every structure is to some degree dynamic, since they all exist in time and can be deformed, however slightly. We can imagine this if we zoom in. Tapping on one side of a piece of diamond causes a shockwave of atomic scale forces which make their way across the crystal lattice of the diamond over to the other side where the tap can be felt, but the effect inevitably takes time to get from one side to the other. When we don't see this, we are simply not looking closely enough.

The pretenst structures that we explore here expose the dynamic nature of structure by making it explicit. A disturbance in one part of a pretenst structure shakes the next element, which shakes the next, until the entire shape is chaotically jittering. The wave of disturbance are there for us to observe, and it should trigger our imagination to picture how this is actually happening always and everywhere.

## Playing with Physics

The pretenst model lets us "play god" and toy with physics, since we're able to change all the physics features freely on the fly while modeling. The real world is far too restricted when you want to really explore this design space. In the real world we experience constant gravity, and our building materials have unchanging features like their elasticity and density. While designing, we need to be free!

Ultimately, of course, when we get to the stage of building the actual physical structures, we must dial back the reckless carefree physics and bring it back to the actual challenges that face us here on Earth (or on the Moon, or in outer space, depending on the goals). The pretenst software is built to take us gradually from the unreal into the real, the objective being always to find ways to build **physical things**.

## Visualizing the Pretension

Pushing elements (bars) are being compressed to be slightly shorter than they would be without the tension, and pulling elements (cables) are being stretched slightly longer than they would be without the bars. In a pretenst tensegrity, everything is strained a bit, because otherwise the structure wouldn't be stiff. This is the heart of the matter!

In the real world such strains are certainly measurable, sometimes visible, but builders need to understand them intimately so that they can do the numbers and make sure things are built to last and carry loads without collapsing.

The pretenst software is all about fostering a deeper understanding of this very thing, so the visualization is set up to allow users to greatly exaggerate the effects of strain. This is very useful in exposing to the designer where the strain is intense and where it is weak or absent altogether.

What the visualization does, almost paradoxically, is that it shows the pushing and pulling elements at the length that they would be if each of them indidually were not strained at all! Compressed bars appear a little bit longer, and stretched cables appear a little bit shorter, so in this visualizztion the two actually do not touch each other (unless the strain happens to be zero).

Depending on the physics parameters, the effect may be so small that you cannot even see it, so pretenst has a feature which multiplies the effect to bring it unambiguously into view.

## The "Zen" State



## Not Stacking Bricks

When we think of building a house, we think of are made of stacking solid bricks on top of one another, maybe with something like cement trowelled in between to stick them together. Gravity holds the bricks down as we build the walls, and we lay down some thick beams horizontally when we need to support a floor. It all seems more or less like an exercise in stacking solid things. There are pushing and pulling forces throughout, but they're hidden to us.

A bridge or a really tall building with some kind of skeleton structure goes a bit further, so then we need to start thinking about where all the forces come from and where they go. This is what civil engineers do for a living. How much weight can this bridge hold? How thick do the beams need to be to hold up this building? Maybe even: How does this building behave during an earthquake?

## Concrete and Steel

Civil engineers don't just use concrete, because they know that concrete on its own will just crumble and fall apart. As we've all seen when we peek through the fence at a building site, the first thing they do is lay down a lattice of steel rods, and only later do they pour the concrete. It's only the combination of the concrete and the pre-tensed steel rods that actually makes it last. Pre-tension is everywhere! It's just mostly hidden.

## The Connection Problem

Building tensegrity structures is generally quite difficult, because the end of every bar has to be connected to four or more cables which converge there. It resembles the top of a circus tent where the pole holding the tent up carries the membrane of the tent, only instead of a membrane there are cables. The pole opposes the force of the cables. The hard part is making a durable connection which joins the cables to hold back the pole, and the reason it's hard is because it is inevitablly the weakest link.

## The Teeter-Taut Transition

Anyone who has ever built a tensegrity structure will know that there's something very tricky about the process. Since all of the compression elements are floating, not touching each other, and tension is what gives the structure its integrity, it doesn't really hold its shape until the last moment. So while you are building, the structure is unstable and teeters. Only when you make the last connection and tighten it up does the structure go completely taut and hold its shape. On the one hand this can be frustrating, but it also goes to show how a tensegrity is a minimal structure, with every part contributing to the whole.

Mostly this happens because we tend to build by progressively making more and more tension cable connections one by one until we get to the final tension cable is in place and ready to be tightened. This makes it hard to actually make the last connection as well because it must be done while the structure is becoming taut.

## Prefab Tension

The whole process changes when the opposite approach is taken. Instead of making individual tension connections one by one until the structure is taut, we can prefabricate the tension network. If the network of cables is constructed beforehand, all of the connections can be made while the cables are in a totally relaxed state, which makes it easier to complete all the connection nodes properly and avoid the imbalance of connecting one when it is slack versus connecting the last one which must be stretched before it can be connected.

Building with prefab tension has its own challenges because the measurements must be made very precisely and an inactive tension network (slack, just laying on the floor) can make it difficult to keep straight which cable connects to which joint. It can become confusing.

The really dramatic advantages of prefabricating the tension becomes clear in the final stage because with the tension network finished, the only thing that remains to be done is insertion of the compression members. If the compression members are nothing but solid bars, the problem of inserting the final ones still remains. They would have to be inserted while the structure is already nearly taut. So the compression members must consist of solid bars with a twist. They must be able to lengthen slightly after insertion.
