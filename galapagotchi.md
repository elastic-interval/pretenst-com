# The Galapagotchi

In the universe of the galapagotchi there are only simple "pretenst" bodies, and they exist in gravity on a sticky surface.

A pretenst body is made up of one dimensional objects that each individually only know about pushing and pulling, but together form a solid but flexible structure in three dimensional space.

There are pretenst animal bodies (gotchis) and plant bodies (satoshi trees).

A gotchi has a body with limbs and a central core, but instead of a brain it has a player, it has **you**, and it needs you.

Gotchis limbs are covered with muscular triangles which can contract together to change the body's shape. Each triangle contraction consumes one satoshi of energy.

A body can survive by eating from the satoshi trees. Before your gotchi can feed, it will first need to be able to move closer to the trees. If you don't get your gotchi to food, it will starve.

When a gotchi body is born, it knows nothing about how to coordinate its muscles, but it is born with a store of energy satoshis.

You the player cannot control the muscle contractions directly. Gotchis discover this coordination by natural selection. Evolution by trial and error is the only way to survive.

Satoshi trees grow very slowly from satoshi rain, rising from the surface and branching outwards as they grow to collect it.
