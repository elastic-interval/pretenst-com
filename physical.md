# Physical Pretenst Structure

It is one thing to play with these structures in the virtual domain with the pretenst app, but experience has taught us that it's another thing entirely when you give yourself the challenge of building physical versions. It's a lot harder!

## Not Stacking Bricks

When we think of building a house, we think of are made of stacking solid bricks on top of one another, maybe with something like cement trowelled in between to stick them together. Gravity holds the bricks down as we build the walls, and we lay down some thick beams horizontally when we need to support a floor. It all seems more or less like an exercise in stacking solid things. There are pushing and pulling forces throughout, but they're hidden to us.

A bridge or a really tall building with some kind of skeleton structure goes a bit further, so then we need to start thinking about where all the forces come from and where they go. This is what civil engineers do for a living. How much weight can this bridge hold? How thick do the beams need to be to hold up this building? Maybe even: How does this building behave during an earthquake?

## Concrete and Steel

Civil engineers don't just use concrete, because they know that concrete on its own will just crumble and fall apart. As we've all seen when we peek through the fence at a building site, the first thing they do is lay down a lattice of steel rods, and only later do they pour the concrete. It's only the combination of the concrete and the pre-tensed steel rods that actually makes it last. Pre-tension is everywhere! It's just mostly hidden.

## The Connection Problem

Building tensegrity structures is generally quite difficult, because the end of every bar has to be connected to four or more cables which converge there. It resembles the top of a circus tent where the pole holding the tent up carries the membrane of the tent, only instead of a membrane there are cables. The pole opposes the force of the cables. The hard part is making a durable connection which joins the cables to hold back the pole, and the reason it's hard is because it is inevitablly the weakest link.

## The Teeter-Taut Transition

Anyone who has ever built a tensegrity structure will know that there's something very tricky about the process. Since all of the compression elements are floating, not touching each other, and tension is what gives the structure its integrity, it doesn't really hold its shape until the last moment. So while you are building, the structure is unstable and teeters. Only when you make the last connection and tighten it up does the structure go completely taut and hold its shape. On the one hand this can be frustrating, but it also goes to show how a tensegrity is a minimal structure, with every part contributing to the whole.

Mostly this happens because we tend to build by progressively making more and more tension cable connections one by one until we get to the final tension cable is in place and ready to be tightened. This makes it hard to actually make the last connection as well because it must be done while the structure is becoming taut.

## Prefab Tension

The whole process changes when the opposite approach is taken. Instead of making individual tension connections one by one until the structure is taut, we can prefabricate the tension network. If the network of cables is constructed beforehand, all of the connections can be made while the cables are in a totally relaxed state, which makes it easier to complete all the connection nodes properly and avoid the imbalance of connecting one when it is slack versus connecting the last one which must be stretched before it can be connected.

Building with prefab tension has its own challenges because the measurements must be made very precisely and an inactive tension network (slack, just laying on the floor) can make it difficult to keep straight which cable connects to which joint. It can become confusing.

The really dramatic advantages of prefabricating the tension becomes clear in the final stage because with the tension network finished, the only thing that remains to be done is insertion of the compression members. If the compression members are nothing but solid bars, the problem of inserting the final ones still remains. They would have to be inserted while the structure is already nearly taut. So the compression members must consist of solid bars with a twist. They must be able to lengthen slightly after insertion.
