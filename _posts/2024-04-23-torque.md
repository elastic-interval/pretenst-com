## Starting with "Mitosis"

Some time ago I built a structure I called ["mitosis"](/construction/2022/08/30/mitosis), which has a very interesting
degree of freedom, because it naturally torques.

That is to say, if you grab the left side with one hand and the right side with the other, you can twist the ends in
opposite directions and it will initially not provide much resistance.

The resistance increases according to how far you have twisted.  Imagine picking this structure up and twisting it
different ways:

Better yet, [order one](https://getpretenst.com/collections/kits/products/adjustable-flemons-pelvis) so you can try
this with your own hands.

It turns out that you can also **remove the center bar** without much change in twisting behavior.

After a while I started to call this structure "torque" instead of "mitosis" because of this twisting
freedom, which I haven't had in other structures built so far.

## Add four cables

But if this structure can twist, and if the resistance increases, it should be possible to simply tie it
in its twisted shape so it freezes that way!

I did this as an experiment and the result was quite nice.

The blue cables here were added to freeze the torque in twisted state.

Once I saw this structure I began to really like it, because suddenly I have a shape with very **interesting
angles** which depend on the degree of twist.

Every compression strut is rotated with respect to what was originally its parallel "brother" strut.

Nowadays I'm thinking of building tensegrity structures based on individual "bricks" which connect triangle-to-triangle,
so this is now a whole new kind of brick!

## Twists both ways

Needless to say, it is once again important to distinguish two different ways to twist this structure,
a left-handed and a right-handed way, just like [the twist sisters](construction/2020/07/13/twist).

So we start with two "torque" structures with no extra twist-preserving cables:

Adding the four new cords in opposite ways creates the two differently-twisted torque structures.

They stand up nicely on one of their triangular "faces" and it's very good to see them side-by-side
so the various twists you see in one of them is comfortably mirror-imaged in the other.

It's interesting to stare at this pair of structures until you can really internalize the fact that
they are opposites, as if you had just one and the other was in the mirror.

## Conclusion

This is an exciting new development!
