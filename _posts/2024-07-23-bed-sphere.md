## Found a discarded bed

One day I was taking out the garbage bag to throw in the container on my street.

It was raining quite hard, but I didn't have to walk far, so I expected to stay fairly dry.

Beside the garbage container someone had discarded a double bed with slats, like this one:

Normal people would probably continue with their day, but I couldn't help but stand there and count the slats, 
because if there were **thirty** or more, I could **make** something out of them!

I was thinking of an interesting structure that I had once made from PVC pipe, which used the springiness of the curving
pipes, rather than relying on the springiness of the cable.  I suppose this is also a kind of tensegrity.

So yes, I ended up spending a long time in the rain getting soaked while demolishing the bed to collect those beautiful
strong curved slats and taking them home.

## Thirty Slats

After collecting and cleaning the slats (one to spare, just in case), I was ready to start figuring out how
to use some Dyneema cord and turn the bed into a **sphere**!

## Four holes equally spaced

The first thing to do is to drill four holes in each slat, and the holes have to be big enough to allow the
cord to pass through, but not too big that they would fail to hold back a knot.

I was actually able to enlist the help of my Sicilian friend, so we were able to turn the process into a fairly
efficient assembly line.

He was drilling holes into slat after slat, which is of course 120 holes in total, while
I got busy cutting 60 cords of approximately the right length and stringing them through the holes.

Then I made a knot at one end of the all the cords and pulled them "upward" through the middle two
holes of each slat.

## Built hanging

Since this thing is going to end up as a sphere, it's a lot easier to hang it and build downwards.

It was very nice to be able to do this with the help of my friend, because it was much easier with four
hands than it would have been with two.

We had to quite forcefully pull the cords through holes which were almost exactly the width of the cord itself,
and then tie a knot, and this all had to happen kind of hanging in midair.

The challenge of putting this together was fun, but as usual in the construction of tensegrity, it only really gets
its shape when you make the final connections.

## Final tightening  

The first time that we had the whole sphere assembled it was quite loose and sagged considerably.

Obviously I had not estimated the length of the cords quite right, but this was not a problem.

All we had to do was pull each of the 60 cords a bit further out, make another knot below the existing one,
and then let it go.

One extra knot everywhere and it was tight!

## Conclusion

This is actually a very easy and gratifying project to do, if you ever find a discarded
bed, because either it goes into the garbage, or it **bounces like a ball**:
