# Halo by Crane

It was the first really complicated tensegrity structure that I attempted!

![building halo](/images/2020-10/twists-medium.jpg)

About a year ago today, I jumped in the deep end and tried to build something that could have only realistically been generated by algorithm on a computer.

My [first effort](/construction/2020/10/26/halo-1) was a hard learning experience, but through [heroic strengthening](/construction/2020/10/26/halo-2) I was able to create a stable Halo.

There was still something bothersome about it. The halo stood for months but I couldn't help but feel sorry for how much stress it was under to stay standing after my strengthening.

One day I decided to tighten it up a little and discovered that it was indeed not really stable enough, for example, to be easily transported.

It weakened further and at one point actually fell over due to a bar having bent crooked. *That hurt.* Cords sprung loose. Disaster.

But I **could not give up on the Halo**, no matter what.

I decided to **rebuild** it from scratch with *mostly the same materials*, but make it **right** this time!

## Bow tie style

I had just fully explored the [bow tie pattern](/construction/2021/04/08/bowtie-tensegrity) by building the very challenging [Convergence](/construction/2021/10/20/convergence) structure, so I knew that this was right for the new Halo.

This way of constructing a tensegrity column resulted in a **much greater resistance to bending** than the technique typically used by Ken Snelson on his Needle.

The weight that the Halo stem has to carry would have made it collapse had I not come up with the [guy wire trick](/construction/2020/10/26/halo-2), but maybe with bow tie style it could be strong enough.

## Gradual Thinning

When I did the strengthening, I had already resolved to use three different thicknesses depending on where a bar was located in the structure.

So I just took this strategy more seriously and bought the right numbers of very thick bars this time.

The thickest would be used for the **entire stem**, going from the bottom all the way up to the omni-twist where it split into the two arms.

The middle thickness would go for the **three** largest twists out into each arm, and the thinnest would be used to complete the loop between the two arms.

## Rings and Bolts

Back last year I was still discovering ways to connect, and I had come up with the tulip technique.

This was labor intensive and in the end it was **not as strong** as it needed to be, since the cords just slipped into the slots.

Since the first Halo was built, I had also developed [new and better techniques](/construction/2021/03/29/six-twist-essential) for making the connections with the cords using **knots** and rings.
