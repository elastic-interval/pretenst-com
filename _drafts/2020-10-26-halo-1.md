## Challenge Accepted

Once I had built a strong metal tensegrity tower out of [brass and tulips](/construction/2020/10/12/brass-and-tulips), I got confidence in the technique and started wondering what could possibly be built this way. Returning to the [pretenst app](/app/) I looked over the structures that I had been able to generate using [tenscript](/tenscript.html), settling on one of the first truly interesting ones, which I had named "Halo by Crane" the moment I saw it.

I guess I was thinking that a halo is something that you might typically hanging from a [skyhook](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p241101), coming from above. This one is held up from the ground by tension, and it's a tensegrity structure that nobody has ever tried to build.

The great Kenneth Snelson could never have written the code for this, since it was not really part of his generation's youth. I started coding as a teenager, so I thought maybe this could be my way of taking Ken's work to a new level.

## Down to Business

The structure consists of 180 joints at the ends of 90 bars with 450 cord segments holding it all together. How could I manage all that complexity? I had to get
