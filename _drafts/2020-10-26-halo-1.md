## Challenge Accepted

Once I had built a strong metal tensegrity tower out of [brass and tulips](/construction/2020/10/12/brass-and-tulips), I got confidence in the technique and started wondering what could possibly be built this way. Returning to the [pretenst app](/app/) I looked over the structures that I had been able to generate using [tenscript](/tenscript.html), settling on one of the first truly interesting ones, which I had named "Halo by Crane" the moment I saw it.

I guess I was thinking that a halo is something that you might typically hanging from a [skyhook](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p241101), coming from above. This one is held up from the ground by tension, and it's a tensegrity structure that nobody has ever tried to build.

The great Kenneth Snelson could never have written the code for this, since it was not really part of his generation's youth. I started coding as a teenager, so I thought maybe this could be my way of taking Ken's work to a new level.

## First Tulips and Brass

The structure consists of 180 joints at the ends of 90 bars, all connected up exactly the right way to share the correct joints. How could I manage all that complexity? I had to come up with ways to keep track of it all, so I ordered a label printer and got busy with the tulips, one hundred eighty of them! This meant also cutting the connector nuts a total of 540 times (3x each).

![tulips-groups][tulips-groups]

This was a time-consuming and repetitive activity, so once again I spaced it over a few days and interspersed and mixed the work with watching some documentaries and listening to some podcasts. I learned about the history of the Japanese Yen while filing the tulips by hand.

## Tubes

Then came the brass bars, each one of them with its own unique length. This is where the label printer came in.

![pipe-cutter][pipe-cutter]

I cut them with the little pipe cutter and labeled each and every one of them so that I would know how to connect them up later. Using the label printer to keep everything straight was great, but it was probably also absolutely necessary.

![bars-labels][bars-labels]

Finally, 90 bars and 180 tulips! (this took a few days).  Each bar was labeled with its two joint numbers followed by its lengths in millimeters. 

    (J1,J2)=L1:L2

The two lengths were the total effective length of the bar-and-tulip combination, followed by the length of the tube itself. For example:

    (2,3)=631:505
    (68,69)=324:242
    (176,177)=147:97

## Cords

Then I began to manufacture cord segments, each segment with its two ends melted with a flame (started with a lighter but eventually bought candles) and formed into a solid blob. I decided that it was better to make the segments first and then measure them so that the error would be minimized, since it's not extremely accurate to cut and then melt the blobs.

I first used graph paper and looked up the lengths in my list in order to stick them to the right place in the list. Initially almost every length had a home, but it got harder to find holes in the list, so I learned how to make the cutting-and-melting into a quite accurate process, to within a millimeter or two.

![cords-1][cords-1]

But yes, then the numbers rose up **and attacked me** because I gradually came to the realization that I would have to cut and form 450 of these and form 900 blobs!!

I bit the bullet and printed the specifications of all the cords on about 9 sheets of paper and then slowly but surely manufactured all of the initial lengths that would be needed. Patience, patience, and besides, I would never be able to convince someone else to do this.

![cords-2][cords-2]

I did stop at some point for a while, because I was getting a little concerned that maybe even after all this preparation work it wouldn't be possible for some reason to actually put together this complex tensegrity.

I had to prove to myself that it wasn't all for nothing, and there was no real convincing guarantee that it would all work.  This was a new tensegrity shape, more complicated than anything I had ever seen.
