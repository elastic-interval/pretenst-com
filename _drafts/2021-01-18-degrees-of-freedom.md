## A New Twist

Early on in our building experiments we created [the twist sisters](/construction/2020/07/13/twist) using some materials that we had cobbled together and bought at a surplus store long ago. They're still nice to grab and squeeze, but we were playing around one day to see if we could make a twist in a very different way.

With just one single elastic cord loop, two ball chains, and three PVC tubes we were able to build a twist "with a twist".

This twist actually has some nice new features! 

As we played with it more, we realized that it could be adjusted, and it would remain in the adjusted form.

The single elastic cord loop makes its journey in a nice zig-zag, passing through the hollow tubes on the way.  It's a nice shape, and with a bit of pushing and pulling you can shift the cord within the tube and change the shape a bit.

The ball chains pass through small holes drilled in the PVC tubes, and they go under the elastic cords. These can also be adjusted by pulling the balls through the holes in either direction.

A second degree of freedom!

The only thing that looks somehow imperfect, or at least not as pretty as it should, is the **knot** which turns the elastic into a loop.

Still, this little twist seemed to have a new kind of potential!  It could have its shape adjusted in two different ways, and after it is changed, it remained in the new shape.
