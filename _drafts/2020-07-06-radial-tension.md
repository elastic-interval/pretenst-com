## The Tension Triangle

These structures, like the [one](http://localhost:4000/construction/2020/06/15/prefab-tension-1) I made a few weeks ago are made up of triangles of tension.

But for this project we're going to look at doing the tension differently.  All that really has to happen is that the three connections being pushed apart by the compression must be held together somehow. Let's try doing it with radial tension instead:

The shape will be the same, but it will be interesting to see how it behaves
