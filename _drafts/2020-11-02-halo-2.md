## A Guy-Wire

In [part 1](/construction/2020/10/26/halo-1) of this series, I was able to construct the Halo by Crane structure but in the end it wasn't able to bear its own weight. I had already replaced the most critical bars with thicker brass tubes.

After periodically staring at the structure (still hung from the ceiling) for a few days while doing other things, one morning I decided to see if there was a way to see if I could push downwards on some bars to counteract the forward-hanging lobe. 

To my surpise, quite carefully, I was able to tilt the lobe upwards and the whole construction basically stayed standing, although it looked painfully strained!

So I added a guy-wire to the back of the structure, in the hope that it would stay standing.

## Standing! But...

I was astounded that it was actually standing, and I only had to add something to compensate for the forward weight of the lobe.

Proudly, I made some snaps of the new miracle, but if you zoom in, you can see that there was still a problem.

Eventually, after challenging it a bit more, things started to break down.
