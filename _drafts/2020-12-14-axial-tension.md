## The Wobble

A while ago I built a strong tensegrity column out of [brass and tulips](/construction/2020/10/12/brass-and-tulips), which has been a great structure to experiment with. The bars are thick enough that you never see them bending at all, and the Dyneema cord is strung very tightly and doesn't seem to suffer from material fatigue much at all. The tower has been standing here for many months now and I never need to tighten it up or anything.
