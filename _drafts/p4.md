# Elastic Interval Geometry

How do shapes exist and maintain integrity in space over time? What is necessary for a model to represent the structural-temporal reality with enough authenticity that it is useful? The best way to approach these fundamental questions is to go back to first principles, and mercilessly shave off any complexity that is not strictly necessary with [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

## Pure Pairwise Push and Pull

To make the simplest shape, the tetrahedron, how many elements are necessary? A tetrahedron is made of four points in 3D space which don't all occupy the same flat plane. There are six relationships between four points, and since the relationships join at the points we will call them **joints**.  

If the tetrahedron exists in time, there must be something which describes what happens between one moment and the next. So a simple model would be to have the six point-to-point relationships push and pull. We will refer to the relationships as **intervals** and since they push and pull in a pairwise fashion we will call them **elastic**. Nothing more is needed, so we can probably now put away Occam's Razor and work out only these details.

## Time

Time is an endless subject of discussion in philosophy as well as in physics. For the purpose of the elastic interval model, all we need is a kind of **fairness**. A joint where several pushing and pulling intervals meet should decide where to go without picking favorite intervals at any given moment. 

If only some of the intervals were "activated" during one moment, the joint may jerk suddenly in one direction. During the next moment, the other intervals may be activated, causing the joint to jerk again. A jerky model would not be very authentic so, the model of time that we will use will operate in a sweeping fashon, where every element gets an opportunity to activate during the same moment.

In other words all parts if the entire model, however many intervals and joints, will experience an entire moment simultaneously and be finished with it before the next moment. The moments effectively **sweep** through the whole model, exactly the way it happens in [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).

## The Robot Two-Step

The dance performed by these joints and intervals is animated by splitting a **moment** in two: first sweeping through the intervals, and then through the joints. During each moment, the intervals will each express their discomfort and the joints will each strive to find the best compromise.

Imagine an interval to be a tiny robot, and a joint as well. Each has its own simple function, and we just let them do their thing. A joint knows where it is in space, but an interval doesn't.

During an **interval sweep**, every interval is activated, which means that it has an opportunity to express itself. The only thing that an interval knows about is that it has a joint at either end, and if these two joints are too close it must shove them apart. Likewise, it must yank them together if they are too distant. That's all.

It's important to realize that the interval doesn't even know about three-dimensions. It has two joints, and its job is to keep them at a certain distance. That's just one dimension, so the interval will compare its current length with the length that it is supposed to be, and if there is a difference, it will have to ask its two joints if they will to fix the situation. It makes length change requests.

When the interval sweep is finished, all intervals have expressed themselves, and the model is ready for the **joint sweep**. Joints have been accumulating length change requests from the interval ends touching them, but a joint interprets each request differently since it knows about three dimensions.

The joint interprets the one-dimensional **push and pull** requests by combining them with the direction of each interval, turning them into **direction** requests. Its job is to mediate between the different intervals and try to satisfy them as well as it can, so it weighs all of the direction requests to decide where to jump. The new position in space should be the best compromise between the needs of the intervals.

When all joints have jumped, the **moment** is finished and the model begins the next moment. Once again the intervals will express their discomfort and the joints will strive to find the best compromise.

## Push versus Pull

What if, in this elastic interval geometry, some intervals only ever push while others only ever pull? Some things like the tetrahedron described above can no longer be built, since it needs its intervals to both push and pull to maintain its shape. The simplest thing in three-dimensional space that could be built if we have specialized only-push and only-pull intervals must have more parts than the tetrahedron.
