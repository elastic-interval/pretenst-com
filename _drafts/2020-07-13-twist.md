## The Twist

It was such a nice experience [last time](/construction/2020/07/06/radial-tension) using tie-wraps and the perforated aluminum connectors, I wanted to try some more structures using radial tension.

This time I'm really going back to the basics, and build the **twist** with just three bars. But in this case, one is not enough since there are two different ones. Here's what the pretenst software shows:

![twist][twist-a]

Looking at your own hands and how your fingers curl compared to where your thumb points, you should be able to se that the left one twirls to the left and the right one twirls to the right.

So actually you could grab these two nicely with your hands, if they were physical rather than just images on the screen, so that's where we want to go.

## Preparing the Parts

Once again, we snip out a triangle, and a row of three.

But wait this time we will take a triangle which is one step bigger, six holes, because I want to be able to stack these twists one on top of the other, and maybe this will make it easier to do that.
