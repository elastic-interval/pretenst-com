## The Twist

It was such a nice experience [last time](/construction/2020/07/06/radial-tension) using tie-wraps and the perforated aluminum connectors, I wanted to try some more structures using radial tension.

This time I'm really going back to the basics, and build the **twist** with just three bars. But in this case, one is not enough since there are two different ones.
