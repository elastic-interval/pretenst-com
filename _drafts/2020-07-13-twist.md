## The Twist

It was such a nice experience [last time](/construction/2020/07/06/radial-tension) using tie-wraps and the perforated aluminum connectors, I wanted to try some more structures using radial tension.

This time I'm really going back to the basics, and build the **twist** with just three bars. But in this case, one is not enough since there are two different ones.

Here's what they should look like:

![twist][twist-a]

Looking at your own hands and how your fingers curl compared to where your thumb points, you should be able to se that the left one twirls to the left and the right one twirls to the right.

So actually you could grab these two nicely with your hands, if they were physical rather than just images on the screen, so that's where we want to go.

## Preparing the Parts

Once again, we snip out a triangle shaped connector, and a row of three holes for the ends of the bars.

![radial]

But wait this time we will take a triangle which is one step bigger, six holes, because I want to be able to stack these twists one on top of the other, and maybe this will make it easier to do that.

![twist][twist-e]

After cutting the aluminum it's sometimes a bit bent, because it's pretty malleable.

![twist][twist-f]

A couple of taps with a hammer flattens them out easily.

## Shaping the Aluminum

![twist][twist-g]

They're still pretty rough and they have nasty sharp edges, but the sander can help with that.

![twist][twist-h]

When the shape is what it should be coming from the sander, a little fine tuning using a Dremel tool makes them just that bit nicer.

![twist][twist-i]

So these are our new connectors, ready to hold the twists together!

![twist][twist-j]

## Assembly: Clicks and Elastic

The tie-wraps are perfect to connect the two because you can measure by counting the clicks that you hear as you pull them slowly tighter. When you tighten one, say, three more clicks, you just have to go and tighten the others by the same number of clicks.

![twist][twist-s]

They meet at the edges of the triangle piece, but this time they leave holes in between the connections because we made the triangles one step bigger.

![twist][twist-t]

The rigid tie-wrap triangles now hold the top and bottom of the twist together, but we still need a connection between the top and the bottom. For this I used segments of 3mm elastic cord, so there was still some flexibility.

![twist][twist-u]

Choosing which on the bottom connects to which on the top determines whether you get a **left twist** or a **right twist**.

![twist][twist-v]

Now let's look at how they stack up, one on top of the other. Stacking the right twist here on top of the left twist, the bars are nicely parallel so this is about right.

![twist][twist-w]

It turns out that it was very nice indeed to have these bigger triangles, because the blocky parts of the tie-wraps actually almost snap together snugly when you put one triangle on top of the other (60 degrees twisted of course).

## Conclusion

Finally I have a **left and right** twist which I can hold in my hands nicely and even stack up with fitting triangles.

![twist][twist-z]

The **twist** is kind of like the tetrahedron of tensegrity: the simplest thing that spreads out in all directions to capture some volume.

This project has made me really appreciate the **twist**, and very conscious of how there are two opposite ones. This is the kind of thing you might know in the back of your head but not fully realize until you have them **in your hands**.

It also prompted me to go back to the drawing board and rewrite the growth algorithm in the pretenst software. I suddenly very much wanted to build twist-by-twist, one at a time, left-right-left-right, but the software didn't work that way yet. Fasten your seatblelts, because my next post will be about the software rewrite.
