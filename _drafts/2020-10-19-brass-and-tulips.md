## Turn up the Tension


My previous project, the [prefab tension tower](/construction/2020/08/10/prefab-tension-1) achieved something interesting. I was able to lengthen the compression bars *as final step* because there were nuts that could be adjusted. The result was satisfying for what it was, but it was just asking to be repeated using **metal** so some higher tension could be reached.

I figured out a way to create brass bars which could be effectively lengthened by connecting the ends to the cords using another screw mechanism, but this time with **steel**.

I got so called "connector nuts" which are elongated, as well as some threaded rods and normal nuts, all of them size M6.

## Tulips

A good analogy for these bar-end devices is "tulips", I thought, because the shape reminded me of the flower (as you'll see) and also hey why not, because I'm Dutch.

I ordered some hollow brass bars with an inner diameter that just fits the M6 threaded rods, so they can be inserted, and yet held back using the normal nut.

The connector nuts need to be the things which connect to the cords and to do so they needed to be cut with the band saw three times each, creating six slits.

The resulting shape is the flower part of the "tulip" where the cords connect. 

![brass][brass-a3]

I found that it was much easier to slip cords into the slits if the top of the slit had more of a "V" shape, so I filed all the slits with a metal file with a triangle cross section.

Now, taking a segment of Dyneema cord and melting the end of it with a flame, I was able to mold a kind of thickened ball at the end of the cord. 

![brass][brass-a5]

The slits are big enough for the cord, but too thin to let the ball part slip through. Also, I found that I was able to get five cords to connect to a single slitted connector nut. I would have preferred to *knot* the ends, but that makes the ball too large to fit five of them inside the hole.

Then of course begins the phase of mass production.

Fortunately while slitting and filing endless numbers of tulips, I was able to listen to some podcasts, some music, and even watch a documentary or two.

## Brass Tubes

Then it was time to cut the brass tube segments, so I got a tiny little pipe cutter from the hardware store and started measuring and cutting.

A complete extensible bar consists of a brass tube and two tulips.

The normal screw can be turned to add significant effective length to the bar!
